## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS: RENDER DEPLOYMENT**

### Automatic Deploy (If GitHub Connected)
Render should automatically detect the push and start deploying.

**Monitor the deployment:**
1. Go to Render dashboard
2. Click on your BlockCity service
3. Watch the "Events" tab for deployment progress
4. Typical deploy time: 5-10 minutes

### After Deployment Completes

**CRITICAL: Run Database Migration**

1. Go to Render dashboard → Your service
2. Click "Shell" tab
3. Run:
```bash
cd bcity
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

Or create a named migration:
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_rev2_complete_features
```

---

## 🧪 **POST-DEPLOY TESTING**

Once Render deployment completes, test these endpoints:

```bash
# Replace with your Render URL
BASE_URL="https://blockcity.onrender.com"  # Update this!

# 1. Test Bitcoin price (existing endpoint)
curl $BASE_URL/api/bitcoin/price

# 2. Test protocol settings (new)
curl $BASE_URL/api/protocol-settings

# 3. Test leaderboard (new)
curl "$BASE_URL/api/leaderboard?type=customers&sortBy=points&limit=10"

# 4. Test admin analytics (new)
curl "$BASE_URL/api/analytics?type=admin&period=30"

# 5. Visit the homepage
open $BASE_URL
```
